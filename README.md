<h1>Multi Search</h1>
Multi Search was initially created to address a situation at my workplace. I was asked to find occurance details of 50 IPs in a folder containing 2000+ backup files. There was no readily available tool to do so. So I created this application. 


Before using flutter, I created similar application using python and TKINTER library. But that application was extremely slow.

So when flutter officially announced flutter for windows, I felt like creating this again.
